## Epoch

- [The Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning](https://mksaad.wordpress.com/2020/02/07/the-difference-between-epoch-batch-and-iteration-in-deep-learning/)

## Training Loss vs Validation Loss 

- Validattion Loss > Training Loss: **underfitting**
- Training Loss > Validation Loss: **overfitting**

## [Architecture, Checkpoints, Weights vs Model](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter1/4?fw=pt#architecture-vs-checkpoints)

An architecture is a succession of mathematical functions to build a model and its weights are those functions parameters.
